        rules apply</span>.<br>2) <span style="font-weight: bold">Awards</span> - This is not an official episode, so
    all you get is bragging rights. <br>3) <span style="font-weight: bold">Respect</span> - I will not tolerate flaming
    or any homophobic, racist, sexist, or any otherwise discriminatory behavior. Insults are tolerated to an extent, use
    common sense.<br>4) <span style="font-weight: bold">Gamethrowing</span> - Any attempt to play against your win
    condition is forbidden.<br>5) <span style="font-weight: bold">Prohibited Activities</span> - <span
        style="font-weight: bold">Spam</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Codes</span>, <span
        style="font-weight: bold">Angleshooting</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">Out of Thread Communication
        (except for Mafia Chat)</span> are all against the rules. Contact me if you are unaware of what any of these
    mean.<br>6) <span style="font-weight: bold">Host Communications</span> - Do not reference any communication you have
    had with a host. If something needs to be clarified with the thread, ask me and I will do so.<br>7) <span
        style="font-weight: bold">Inactivity</span> - You will receive a prod if you don't post game-related content in
    a 24 hour time span. Then you will have 12 hours from the time I <span
        style="text-decoration: underline">sent</span> your prod to post game-related content in the thread. If you get
    prodded a 2nd time, you will be force replaced. I will be lenient for extreme reasons (e.g., a family emergency came
    up, preventing you from posting), but do not exploit this. <span style="font-weight: bold">Coronavirus
        (COVID-19)-related reasons for inactivity will be treated on a case-by-case basis.</span><br>8) <span
        style="font-weight: bold">Messages</span> - Do not edit quotes with the purpose to mislead. Send night
    day/actions to me via PM with the subject "XX6 Day/Night Action" or you can message me on Discord at
    chitownmvp01#0191<br>9) <span style="font-weight: bold">Voting</span> - Please bold your votes and type them as
    "<span style="font-weight: bold">/vote [x]</span>" or "<span style="font-weight: bold">/unvote</span>". Votes not in
    proper format will not be counted. I will be strict about this since I use command + F when counting votes.
    Plurality and majority lynch are enabled. Ties are broken by RNG. Day 1 lynch is enabled. <br>10) <span
        style="font-weight: bold">Days/Nights</span> - 72 hour days/24 hour nights<br>11) <span
        style="font-weight: bold">Mafia Chat</span> - The Mafia Chat will be on Discord and the Mafia can use it 24/7.
    <br>12) <span style="font-weight: bold">Flavor</span> - The flavor for this game will be DC Universe themed. The
    flavor will be used for story/enjoyment purposes, it is not to be used to make game-related conclusions. Familiarity
    with DC Universe is not required. If you need clarification (e.g., you don't know what I'm talking about if your
    night result says "You were controlled by Amanda Waller!"), please let me know and I will clarify for you. <br>13)
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Joining Requirements</span> - Standard joining rules, but a Discord account is
    required because the Mafia Chat will be on that platform. WOTM is enabled. <br>14) <span
